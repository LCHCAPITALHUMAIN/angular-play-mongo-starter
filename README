An app to help you get started with AngularJS, Play! Scala, and MongoDB.

The whole app (including the Angular stuff) can be built, tested and deployed within the Play! lifecycle.
This makes it easy to push it up to Heroku or similar. It also makes it easy for non-UI guys (like me) to get started.

I am trying to keep this up to date by porting over changes to a real app I am working on so may be a bit behind here.

Features:

* examples of Javascript unit test, server side integration / browser tests
* jsTest task added to build to allow running of Javascript tests using Karma/Jasmine (by default assumes karma/phantomjs installed globally)


I have used various resources from all over the place to put this together, some of those I can remember include:
